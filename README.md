# Rego

Rego is a social networking app that allows you to easily find the people you've crossed paths with in REAL LIFE(yes, all those people who caught your eye but didn't dare approach). With Rego, we give you the opportunity to create your own luck.

How does it work? 
1. When you cross paths with someone in real life who has a Rego account, their profile appears on your app.

2. Check your feed to find all the profiles you've crossed paths with. For each profile, you can also see where you crossed paths.

3. Like someone? Just swipe right. We promise you that the other person will not know about it unless they like you too (yes, you might get lucky ;) ). 

4. You like each other? Perfect, but that's not all. Start a conversation with them. Send them texts, photos, videos, audio, and more!

Downloading and using the app is FREE!
